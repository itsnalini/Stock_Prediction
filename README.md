Stock Price Prediction using Facebook Prophet 
TSLA (2022.10.10 - 2023.10.10)
# Executive Summary
In this project, I will build a Facebook Prophet Machine Learning model to predict the price of Tesla (from October 10th, 2022 to October 10th, 2023) for the next 30 days. Additionally, I will perform the data visualization through graph and chart to represent the historical performance of Tesla. Secondly, I will evaluate the model performance using real data from Googe Finance. Third, I will dive into Yahoo Finance stock analysis of Tesla and discuss about PE Ratio, EPS, BEta, Market Cap, Volume, and price range of Tesla. 

#Tools using in this project:
- Python
- Google Sheets
- Pandas, Plotly, Fbprophet
- Yahoo Finance

#Methodology:
1. Data Visualization
2. Data Preparation & Modeling
3. Forcasting
4. Forecast Evaluation Using Google Finance and Google Sheets
5. Conclusion

#Conclusion:
The model has given us a clear direction based on price, that the stock price of Tesla is going to rise since based on price only, Tesla has gone up since the last one year. As a matter of fact, one year ago, the price of Tesla was $222.96 and today it is around $263.62, which is approximately 16% growth. 

Based on the parameters and statistics on Yahoo Finance, the current price is $263.62 which is $3,95 more than yesterday. Looking at the 52 Week Range, Tesla has increased from $101.81 to $299.29, which is 3 times growth. If we expect Tesla to have the same kind of growth in the future, it means the Market Cap of Tesla as to go from $826.727 billion to ($826.727 billion * 3 = $ 2,480.181 billion) which is quite impossible to happen. Therefore, we will examine other statistical elements:

- One Year Target Market of $238.39 which is lower than the current price. Since the Target Estimation is lower than the current price, the Market and analysts are bearish which mean Tesla is overvalued and they expect the price of Tesla to go down.
- PE ratio is 75.11 which is quite normal.
- The Beta of Tesla is 2.25:  Compared to Google or Netflix who have the Beta of 1.02 and 1.25 respectively, Teslaâ€™s stock is more risky, but also has a higher reward potential since they deviate more than the market. Therefore, day traders, who make a profit off volatility, would be beneficial from this.

In conclusion, if you are looking for a long-term investment, Tesla would not be a good option.
